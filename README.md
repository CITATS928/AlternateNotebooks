# AlternateNotebooks
research into things other than Jupyter Notebook

### Group Research

As a group, Look into the various notebook tech below, decide on four to present of them, and talk to the instructor about it.

Once given the go-ahead, research the tech and talk about it within the group. Gather lots of info about the tech, putting links to articles, tutorials, and the tech itself into your copy of this repo. (Make a folder in the repo, name it after your tech, and add all your materials there.)

### Presentation

For each notebook tech chosen, create a simple Google Slides presentation on the notebook projects/products your group reviewed. Compare and contrast against Jupyter Notebook. Each tech preso should be about 6 slides long:
- 1: Describe the tech, who built it, what its key features are
- 2: Explain the special features that the creators stress
- 3: Compare it to Jupyter
- 4: Contrast against Jupyter, what does it do that is really different
- 5: Explain where you might use this instead of Jupyter
- 6: Give a recommendation as to whether or not you'd like to use it.

### Demonstration

Develop a quick, 5 minute demo of the notebook, showing what it looks like. 

### So the four of you

Are creating four different presentations and demos, but need to all agree on how you will compare and contrast each notebook tech that y'all have chosen.

#### Places to start

These ones that can use languages like Python (and others).

- https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb
- https://zeppelin.apache.org/
- https://polynote.org/
- Pycharm's notebook interface
- VSCODE's notebook interface

There may be others more interesting to you and your group. Just clear it with the instructor first.

These are different. How? And Why?

You get 1,000,000 extra points (each) if you find a notebook tech not listed here(!).
